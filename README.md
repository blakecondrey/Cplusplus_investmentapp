C++ investment application showing compound interest

For this project, we were tasked with developing a fiscal responsibility investment application for high school students, that interaced with them on investing and 
the power of compound interest. By following the program specs, we were to capture user input to display their initial investment, how it would grow with 
user determined interest, as well as adding monthly deposits, for a user determined amount of years.
